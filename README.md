**Date:** February 20th, 2025

**Instructor:** [Simona Merlini](https://merlinis12.github.io/merlinisimona.github.io/), Francesca Vitali

**Requirements:** R, RStudio ([download link](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html)) 

## Workshop Overview

Building on the foundation of identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from our [previous workshop](https://github.com/merlinis12/RNA-Seq-Data-Analysis-in-R/wiki), it's time to unlock the biological meaning behind those findings. In this session, we'll dive into powerful downstream analyses to uncover the rich insights hidden in your RNA-seq data.

## Key Learning Goals:
- Conduct [Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)](https://github.com/merlinis12/Downstream-Analysis-of-RNA-Seq-Results/wiki#5-gene-set-enrichment-analysis-gsea) for pathway-level insights.
- Build [Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Networks](https://github.com/merlinis12/Downstream-Analysis-of-RNA-Seq-Results/wiki#6-protein-protein-interaction-ppi-networks) to explore functional connections between genes.
- Explore [drug repurposing](https://github.com/merlinis12/Downstream-Analysis-of-RNA-Seq-Results/wiki#7-drug-repurposing) opportunities based on RNA-seq data.
