## <span style="color: greenyellow">Workshop Overview</span>

After identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as we did in the [previous workshop](https://github.com/merlinis12/RNA-Seq-Data-Analysis-in-R/wiki), itâ€™s critical to interpret these findings in a biological context. In this workshop, we will explore downstream analyses you can perform using RNA-seq data.

## Key Learning Goals:
- Conduct [Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)](https://github.com/merlinis12/Downstream-Analysis-of-RNA-Seq-Results/wiki#5-gene-set-enrichment-analysis-gsea) for pathway-level insights.
- Build [Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Networks](https://github.com/merlinis12/Downstream-Analysis-of-RNA-Seq-Results/wiki#6-protein-protein-interaction-ppi-networks) to explore functional connections between genes.
- Explore [drug repurposing](https://github.com/merlinis12/Downstream-Analysis-of-RNA-Seq-Results/wiki#7-drug-repurposing) opportunities based on RNA-seq data.
